#+TITLE: Game Log Event Labeling Technical Challenge
#+AUTHOR:

* Goal of the Technical Challenge

Label an SSL game log file for specific event types (with associated
metadata). Being able to detect important game events can be useful
for the decision making algorithms of the robots. Additionally, in
future years, being able to automatically label events with associated
metadata may lead to more explainable auto-ref decisions and
potentially auto commentary on a game.

* Event Types

There are two event types: instantaneous and durations. Instantaneous
events have a label associated with a specific time in the
log. Duration events have a label associated with a range of time in
the log.

** Dribbling

Detect when dribbling is occuring. This is an instantaneous
event. Dribbling is defined as one robot is touching the ball with the
dribbler. The decision is based on the same criteria used in the
[[https://robocup-ssl.github.io/ssl-rules/sslrules.html#_excessive_dribbling][excessive dribbling rule]].

The following table summarizes the metadata associated with this event.

| Field        | Description                         |
|--------------+-------------------------------------|
| IsDribbling? | Is a robot dribbling in this frame? |
| Robot ID     | Which robot is dribbling            |
| Robot Team   | Which team is dribbling             |

** Ball Possession

Detect which robot/team is in control of the ball (if any). This is an
instantaneous event.

The following table summarizes the metadata associated with this
event.

| Field    | Description                                                     |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| State    | One of the following values: yellow-posses, blue-posses, none   |
| Robot ID | Which robot is in possession (ignored if loose state is chosen) |

The state refers to who is in control of the ball. Either yellow, blue
or no team (none). The none state applies both when the ball is free
on the field, and when the ball is under contention from opposing team
robots.

** Passing

Detect pass attempts. This is a duration event. The duration lasts
from when the ball leaves the passer and ends when the pass either
reaches the receiver or fails (out of bounds, intercepted, deflected).

| Field       | Description                                     |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Start Time  | When did the pass start                         |
| End Time    | When did the pass end                           |
| Successful? | Did the pass reach a receiver on the same team? |
| Passer ID   | Which robot was the one who passed the ball     |
| Passer Team | Which team is passing                           |
| Receiver ID | Which robot was the intended recipient          |

** Goal Shots

Detect attempts at scoring a goal. This is a duration event. The
duration lasts from when the ball leaves the shooter and ends when the
ball either enters the goal, or is stopped/deflected by a robot.

| Field        | Description                          |
|--------------+--------------------------------------|
| Start Time   | When did the shot start              |
| End Time     | When did the shot end                |
| Successful?  | Did the shot enter the goal?         |
| Shooter ID   | Which robot took the shot?           |
| Shooter Team | Which team did the shooter belong to |


* Procedure

During the competition, two of the game logs. These game logs will be
pre-processed by the tools described in the software section
below. Participants will receive a copy of the pre-processed game
logs. A ground truth label file for these logs will be created by the
TC. The TC will attempt to use game logs from games where none of the
participants in this challenge played. This is to prevent an advantage
for teams that may have saved additional information in their own log
files. However, as this cannot be guaranteed, we will require all
participants to label 2 different game logs, so at most a participant
in this challenge will have competed in a single game log.

Participants will produce their own set of labels for this game log
using the provided pre-processed data files. Teams will submit their
log files to the TC for scoring. The submitted label files will be
scored using the released scoring program. Participants will be ranked
by score, with higher scores being better.

Participants can use any approach that is automated to label the
data. In other words, you must label the data with an algorithm that
does not require human interaction. You cannot hand-label the data,
you cannot ask for human assistance, and you cannot correct the labels
produced by your software.

You may use any algorithm for labeling (rule-based, deep learning,
etc.). You can also use a non-causal labeling algorithm (i.e. your
labeling can look at future events to help label the current
event). Non-causal labeling may be useful in ambiguous situations.

The participants should label all frames with the appropriate
instantaneous event types and metadata. To ease scoring, the number of
duration events in the ground truth data will be provided to the
participants before they produce their labels. This is to avoid having
to do sequence alignment of the ground truth and participant label
files.

** File Formats and Utilities

various utilities and file formats used in this challenge. The colors
of the boxes indicate who is responsible for running the

* Scoring

Scoring differs by event type.

** Instantaneous Event Scoring

Each instantaneous event has a state label (e.g. dribbling or
not). For each frame that matches the ground truth labels, +1
point. For each matching piece of metadata +0.5 points.

** Duration Event Scoring

Duration events main score will be calculated using the Intersection
over Union (IoU) of the start and end times. The IoU is equal to the
area of overlap over the area of the union.

\begin{equation}
IoU = \frac{\text{area of overlap}}{\text{area of union}}
\end{equation}

The IoU is guaranteed to be $\le 1$. All IoU will be added
up. Additionally, each correct piece of metadata for an event will add
+0.5 points to the score.

Before calculating scores, event labels will be aligned using the
Smithâ€“Waterman alignment algorithm with a gap penalty of zero. This is
to prevent incorrect labels from being scored wrong

Ground Truth labels: 
  - 0 - 10
  - 11 - 20
  - 21 - 30

Team labels:
  - 0 - 5
  - 6 - 10
  - 11 - 20

Without alignment the IoU score would become: 0.5 + 0 + 0.

When in reality the IoU score should be: 0.5 + 1.

** Final Score

Each category will be ranked individually in order to make each label
category equally important for an overall win. Depending on the
ranking in that category, each participant will get an amount of
overall points. The amount of points is equal to $\text{number of
participants} - \text{placement}$. So that first place has the most
points, and last place has the least. For example, with 7 participants
first place would get 6 points, second place 5, etc.

Each of the category points will then be totaled to determine an
overall winner. This way each event type accuracy is equally
important, as they all contribute to the final score evenly.


* Software Tooling

All software tooling is located in a separate repo: https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-rust-tools

Below is an overview of the different parts, but refer to the
repository for more details on usage and file formats.

** Label Preprocessing

We have provided a simple tool that will process an SSL game log
file. This will strip unnecessary messages as well as group messages into
discrete frames that can be labeled.

** Labeler

We have provided a simple UI for creating label files. This can be
used to manually label training data for your algorithms. This will
also be the tool used by the TC to produce the ground truth labels.

** Scoring Program

We have provided a scoring tool. It will take in two different label
files, one ground truth and one to be scored, and produce a score for
each category described above.

* File Format

There are two formats: a data file format and a label file format.

The data file is produced by the log preprocessor tool. The label file
is the list of labels for each of the frames in the data file. Both
use protobuf files and are designed to support fast random access.
