== Overall Scoring

As each stage is quite different in terms of scoring, in order to
determine an overall winner, each stage will be ranked individually by
total score. Depending on ranking in the category, each participant
will get an amount of overall points. The amount of points is equal to
the number of participants - placement in that stage. For example,
with 7 participants, first place gets 6 points, second place gets 5,
etc.

Each of the stage points will then be totaled to determine an overall
winner. Therefore, performance in all stages is considered equal in
the final scoring.

In the event of a tie, the team with the lowest total time across all
the stages will win.
