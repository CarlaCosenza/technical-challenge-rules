== Hardware/Software Requirements

While we encourage participants to attempt the use of their blackout
solutions during main competition to help deal with noise and dropouts
in the global vision system, we recognize that integration into the
main competition robots is a difficult task. For these reasons, the
hardware restrictions are relaxed for this technical challenge.

Teams may still remotely control their robots during normal
competition, however, we encourage teams to experiment with onboard
processing and autonomy. Regardless of where the control software
executes, team will not receive data from the SSL vision
software. Teams will still receive start, stop, and halt ref commands
which will be used to initiate and stop trials of each stage.

All robot hardware requirements apply to this challenge **EXCEPT** the
height restrictions and the pattern markings. Participant robots may
be taller than the rules dictate. The vision markings may also be
obscured/absent. However, other rules such as maximum speed, kick
power, ball manipulation strategies, etc. must still be observed.

There are no restrictions on onboard sensor types. External sensors
not attached to the robot are not allowed for this competition. We
encourage teams to be creative in their choice of sensors and their
strategies for completing each stage of the challenge. There is no
restriction on processing power or where the processing takes
place. However, keep in mind that bandwidth at competition is limited,
so solutions requiring streaming large amounts of data wirelessly will
likely not work.
