== Evaluation

The TC reserves the right to change the evaluation procedure.

Every team places the ball in the same situations. The number and kind of
situations will be determined by the TC. The command will be issued and the
teams have to place the ball in 15 seconds and move away from the ball.

A point will be awarded for every successfully placed ball. In case of ties,
the team that was capable of placing the balls in the least amount of time
wins.
